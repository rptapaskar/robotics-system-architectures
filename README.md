# Robotics System Architectures

This repository documents **system-level architectures for robotics research, teaching, and deployment**.

The emphasis is on **how robotic systems are structured**, how information and control flow across layers, and how research ideas translate into executable systems.

This repository intentionally prioritizes **architecture, abstraction, and system thinking** over platform-specific implementations.

---

## Motivation

Many robotics projects fail not because of weak algorithms, but due to:
- Poor system decomposition
- Tight coupling between perception, planning, and control
- Lack of clarity between simulation and real-world execution

This repository addresses these gaps by focusing on **clear architectural patterns** that are reusable across platforms, domains, and research problems.

---

## Scope

The repository covers:

- Robotic system decomposition and layering
- Perception → decision → action pipelines
- Control and execution abstraction layers
- Feedback, monitoring, and fault-handling pathways
- Simulation-to-real-world alignment strategies

The content is **tool-agnostic** and applicable to industrial robots, mobile robots, and research platforms.
