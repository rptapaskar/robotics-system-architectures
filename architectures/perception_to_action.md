# Perception-to-Action Architecture in Robotics

This document outlines a generic perception-to-action architecture used in
robotic systems, separating sensing, representation, decision-making, and execution.

## Motivation
Most robotics failures arise not from algorithms but from poor system integration.
This architecture emphasizes modularity, observability, and replaceability.

## Architectural Blocks
- Sensors & raw data acquisition
- Preprocessing and representation
- Decision / planning layer
- Control and execution layer
- Feedback and monitoring

## Research Opportunities
- Latency-aware decision layers
- Learning-enabled perception with safety constraints
- Bridging simulation and real-world execution
