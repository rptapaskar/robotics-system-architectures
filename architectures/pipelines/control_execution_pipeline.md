# Control and Execution Pipeline

This document describes a generic control and execution pipeline for robotic systems.

## Key Concerns
- Determinism vs adaptability
- Real-time constraints
- Safety and fault handling

## Pipeline Stages
- Command generation
- Controller abstraction
- Actuator interface
- State feedback

## Notes
This pipeline is intentionally tool-agnostic and applicable across platforms.
